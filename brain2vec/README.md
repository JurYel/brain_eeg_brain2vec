## ðŸ§  Model Summary
# brain2vec
An autoencoder model for brain structure T1 MRIs based on [Brain Latent Progression](https://github.com/LemuelPuglisi/BrLP/tree/main). The autoencoder takes in a 3d MRI NIfTI file and compresses to 1200 latent dimensions before reconstructing the image. The loss functions for training the autoencoder are:
- [L1Loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.L1Loss.html)
- [KLDivergenceLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.KLDivLoss.html)
- [PatchAdversarialLoss](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/losses.html#patchadversarialloss)
- [PerceptualLoss](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/losses.html#perceptualloss)



# Training data
[Radiata brain-structure](https://huggingface.co/datasets/radiata-ai/brain-structure): 3066 scans from 2085 individuals in the 'train' split. Mean age = 45.1 +- 24.5, including 2847 scans from cognitively normal subjects and 219 scans from individuals with an Alzheimer's disease clinical diagnosis.

# Example usage
```
# get brain2vec model repository
git clone https://huggingface.co/radiata-ai/brain2vec
cd brain2vec

# set up virtual environemt
python3 -m venv venv_brain2vec
source venv_brain2vec/bin/activate

# install Python libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# create the csv file inputs.csv listing the scan paths and other info
# this script loads the radiata-ai/brain-structure dataset
python create_csv.py

mkdir ae_cache
mkdir ae_output

# train the model
nohup python brain2vec.py train \
  --dataset_csv /home/ubuntu/brain2vec/inputs.csv \
  --cache_dir   ./ae_cache \
  --output_dir  ./ae_output \
  --n_epochs    10 \
> train_log.txt 2>&1 &

# model inference
python inference_brain2vec.py \
  --checkpoint_path /path/to/model.pth \
  --input_images /path/to/img1.nii.gz /path/to/img2.nii.gz \
  --output_dir ./vae_inference_outputs \
  --embeddings_filename pca_output/pca_embeddings_2.npy \
  --save_recons
```

# Methods
Input scan image dimensions are 113x137x113, 1.5mm^3 resolution, aligned to MNI152 space (see [radiata-ai/brain-structure](https://huggingface.co/datasets/radiata-ai/brain-structure)).  

The image transform crops to 80 x 96 x 80, 2mm^3 resolution, and scales image intensity to range [0,1]. Images are flattened to 614400-length 1D vectors.
